- To connect nextJS to prisma we need to install two packages:

1. Prisma: Needed in dev mode or CI/CD pipeline. It helps manage the database by creating and executing migration, pulling/pushing from/to database. It is hoever not needed in production 
2. Prisma client: It is used to connect the postgresQL database to the NextJS application and also executes the sequel queries. It is required in production

- After installing those two packages, initialize prisma with command: "npx prisma init"

- Next steps:
1. Set the DATABASE_URL in the .env file to point to your existing database. If your database has no tables yet, read https://pris.ly/d/getting-started
2. Set the provider of the datasource block in schema.prisma to match your database: postgresql, mysql, sqlite, sqlserver, mongodb or cockroachdb.
3. Run "npx prisma db pull" to turn your database schema into a Prisma schema.
4. Run "npx prisma generate dev --name <migration name>" to generate the Prisma Client. You can then start querying your database.

NB: Prisma client stores all the type definitions inside node_modules directory, so, when building and deploying the application to vercel or CI/CD 
pipeline, we need to re-install all the node_modules and re-generate the prisma client type definitions as part of the build process or post-installation generate them.
This can be done by modifying the build script inside the package.json file as: "build": "npx prisma generate && next build"
